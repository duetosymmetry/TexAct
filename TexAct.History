2013

27 Jan  * Released with version 0.3.1

1  Feb  Added TexIndexForm and fixed bug with coloured indices.

19 June Added $TexSmallFractionExponent

8 July Added the option TexBreakBy -> "TexPoint" to TexBreak

9 July Added TexPrintAlignedEquations

18 July - Fixed TexBreak so it only breaks at bracket level 0. -TeXForm crashes when given a StyleBox, so now we remove style boxes before passing anything to TexForm. This also gives a better fix for the problem with the coloured indices.
-FormatTexBasis introduced.
